    "So far, we have only dealt with linear data structures (linked lists, stacks, and queues), where items follow each other one by one. But in a tree, there is a parent-child relationship between items. In a tree, we start with a root node, and each node has some children it points to. All nodes have a parent, except root node, and root node is the ancestor of all the rest. A node without any child is called a leaf node. Trees can be very useful to some real life applications, such as a computer's file system.  "
